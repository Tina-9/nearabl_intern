# Nearabl iOS Swift Exercise

This is my submission for the Nearabl Internship iOS Coding Exercise.

## Project Description

An iOS app built with Swift featuring:

- A Login page to input Email and Password.
- And validation for login credentials.
- Navigation to a Welcome page after successful login.
- Display of the user's email address on the Welcome page.
- The current NYC weather, the API from OpenWeatherMap website.
- Logout button to return to the Login page.

## How to Run

1. Download this repository.
2. Open the files using Xcode.
3. Then install CocoaPods and pod in Terminal.
4. Download the simulator, also select an iPhone Simulator (iPhone 16 / iPhone 16 Pro Max).
5. Press the Run button ▶️ in Xcode to launch the app.
6. Use a laptop, uncheck the "Connect Hardware Keyboard" button.

## Details

- The valid login credentials are:
  - **Emails**: "intern@nearabl.com", "hello@nearabl.com"
  - **Password**: "2025"
- If login information is incorrect, an alert will appear.
- Ensure the device connects to the internet. So it can fetch real-time weather data.
